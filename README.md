Fraud prevention system has been helping consumers saving millions of dollars per year. By recognizing suspicious patterns in a transaction, a system may send fraudulent transaction alerts and prevent a transaction from being approved, thus saving customers’ money from fraudulent activities. However, such systems are not perfect yet, and sometimes wrongful alerts and credit cards block happened where it shall not. Improving the efficacy of such systems would not only help hundreds of thousands of businesses and consumers reduce their fraud losses and increase their revenue, but also help improve users’ experience.

This was a Kaggle research competition. In this competition, the data comes from Vesta’s real-world e-commerce transactions and contains a wide range of features from device type to product features. 

This project is divided into 2 parts:

Part 1: predict fraud transaction using XGBoost

Part 2: predict fraud transaction using Deep Neural Network
